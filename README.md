## Introduction
Hello everyone welcome to my solution to this challenge, sorry about any typos, spent the whole weekend working on it. As it is right now the site does not support cellphones, since I couldn't implement media queries yet. In case I have to put the hosting from Azure down, there's some pictures of how the website looks down bellow.
